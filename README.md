# Ember-micro-addon

The concept of ember-micro-addons is to quickly define a small ember-addon in a flat file structure.

Specifically, for **components**, this would mean that a component addon would consist of

* package.json
* index.js
* component.js
* template.hbs
* style.css

For **libraries**, the addon would consist of

* package.json
* index.js
* library.js

Lastly, for **helpers**, the addon consists of

* package.json
* index.js
* helper.js

Thanks to the contents of `index.js` this addon can be installed and used from an ember app. To follow convention, it is also possible to "build" the addon so it gets a proper, conventional ember-addon file structure by running a single command.

# Usage

Currently, ember-micro-addon is not supported as a global command. Instead, the user is required to initialize an npm package and install the addon as a dependency into that folder.

* `mkdir working_folder`
* `cd working_folder`
* `npm install --save-dev ember-micro-addon

È®nce these 3 steps are done, the `ember micro` command set is available. There are several commands it supports:

* `ember micro:component addon-name` creates a component micro-addon folder containing files listed in the previous section
* `ember micro:library addon-name` creates a library micro-addon
* `ember micro:helper addon-name` creates a helper micro-addon
* `ember micro:build addon-name` copies files from the `addon-name` folder into the folder `addon-name/dist`. Files are copied in a way that complies with the default ember-addon filestructure:
  * `index.js` and `package.json` go to the root,
  * `component.js` goes to `app/components`,
  * `template.hbs` goes to `app/templates/components`,
  * `style.css` goes to `addon/styles` so it gets merged into `vendor.css`
  * `helper.js` goes to `app/helpers
  * `library.js` goes to `app/lib`
